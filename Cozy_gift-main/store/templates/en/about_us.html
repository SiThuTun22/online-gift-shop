                    <h3> The Spark </h3>
                    <p>It began at Myanmar Institute of Information Technology at 2020 rooted by 4 friends with a simple realization - in our fast-paced digital world, the art of thoughtful gifting was getting lost in generic mass-produced items. In 2008, our team of passionate developers and artisan advocates came together in Mandalay with a shared vision: to create a digital bridge between skilled craftspeople and discerning gift-seekers worldwide.</p>
                    <h3> First Bloom</h3>
                    <p>What started as a university project between coffee-fueled coding sessions has blossomed into a global marketplace. We taught ourselves Django to build a robust platform that could handle intricate custom orders while maintaining that personal touch. Nights turned into mornings as we perfected the balance between technical precision and artistic expression.</p>
                    <h3> Standing On Firm Business</h3>
                    <p>We have been standing on bussiness for 4 years and now partnering with 85 local makers, we've delivered 5,000+ smiles across the city. Now many people are contacting us to enjoy bouquets and cake orders accessorized with chocolates and teddy bears to make memorable moments with their loved ones in seasonal occasions.</p>
